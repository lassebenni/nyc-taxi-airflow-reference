"""Final-state Week 12 taxi_pipeline (post-Chapter 5).

Reference snapshot students can diff their own ``dags/taxi_pipeline.py``
against if they get stuck. Ends up here after applying:

  - Chapter 4: three-task dependency chain (ingest -> dbt_run ->
    dbt_test), per-student schema isolation via ``AIRFLOW_STUDENT``,
    ``DBT_ENV`` injected through ``BashOperator.env``.
  - Chapter 5: monthly + catchup schedule, ``{{ ds }}``-templated
    download URL, delete-then-append idempotent load.
  - Chapter 7: ``response.raise_for_status()`` so a TLC 403/404 fails
    ``ingest_taxi_month`` cleanly instead of silently saving the HTML
    error body as a "parquet" and blowing up at dbt_run with a cryptic
    Parquet-magic-bytes error.
  - Chapter 8: runs on local Astro (Airflow 3 via Astro CLI) and on the
    shared class VM (same Airflow 3 via Docker Compose) without change.
    Picks up ``include/dbt_project/`` from either the Astro path or the
    Docker-Compose path via ``find_dbt_dir()`` below.

Design notes:

  - Download+load are one task (not two) because passing a filesystem
    path through XCom between tasks is fragile under Airflow 3's
    TaskSDK (the downstream task sees the path through the
    ExecutionAPI, and pandas/pyarrow can end up treating it as a
    Buffer instead of a file). Keeping both in one process sidesteps
    the whole class of issues: the parquet bytes live in local
    memory, get read by pandas directly, then land in Postgres.
  - dbt_run and dbt_test stay separate because they are genuinely
    distinct units of work — run materializes, test asserts. Seeing
    ``dbt_test`` red while ``dbt_run`` is green is a load-bearing
    signal for Ch7 debugging.

Requires:
  - Astro CLI 1.40+ (local) or the class shared VM (Airflow 3.2 on
    Docker Compose) with apache-airflow-providers-postgres,
    psycopg2-binary, pyarrow, pandas, requests available.
  - ``AIRFLOW_STUDENT`` env var set (Astro reads ``.env``; the VM
    takes it from the Docker Compose ``environment`` block) — picks
    the ``airflow_<name>`` schema this DAG writes into.
  - ``azure_pg`` Airflow Connection (seeded on the VM via bicep, or
    added manually in Astro's UI for local dev) pointing at
    hyf-data-pg.postgres.database.azure.com with ``sslmode=require``.
  - Week 10 dbt project mounted at ``include/dbt_project/``
    (Astro: ``/usr/local/airflow/include/dbt_project``;
    VM:    ``/opt/airflow/include/dbt_project``). The ``DBT_DIR``
    constant below auto-detects which one is present.
